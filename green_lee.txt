Got a badge, a Red Rider at Rocket Camp out at Nohack Peak
Lookin' for jailbirds left and right gotta knock 'em up out the tree
Everybody I know's watchin' Clint, we all like watchin' Clint
Hi Hi Hi Hi
All the li'l Snaps wanna be like Clint; they all wanna be like Clint
But I wanna be like Lee Van Cleef; ya know I wanna be like Lee
Whatever happened to Lee Van Cleef; whatever happened to Lee?
A yellow Studebaker with a 302, I see the green Naugahyde
He put a coupla dings in that pick-up truck, a few more dents in his pride
At Hilltop Drive-In they're watchin' Clint; they all like watchin' Clint
Hi Hi Hi Hi
All the babies scream they wanna see ol' Clint; they all wanna see ol' Clint
But I wanna see Lee Van Cleef; ya know I'd like to see ol' Lee
Whatever happened to Lee Van Cleef; whatever happened to Lee?
Now the Studebaker's gone, Lee's passed on, Clint's still sharp as can be
Hilltop Drive-In is an Auto Mall, but no one's built over Lee
He'll get a kick outta watchin' Clint, we all get a kick outta Clint
Hi Hi Hi Hi
But Lee never been none quite like Clint, there's really only one Clint
But I really did like Lee Van Cleef; I sure did really like Lee
Whatever happened to Lee Van Cleef; whatever happened to Lee?
We still get a kick outta watchin' Clint; we all get a kick outta Clint
Hi Hi Hi Hi
There ain't never been one quite like Clint, there's really only one Clint
I always did like Lee Van Cleef; always did like Lee
Nobody's steely like Lee Van Cleef. Whatever happened to Lee?
Whatever happened to Lee Van Cleef? Don't forget about Lee.
